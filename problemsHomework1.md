# MIS4310 – Programming in Java
# Homework 1

IMPORTANT NOTES:
•	In Eclipse IDE, Students should create a new project named: HOMEWORK_1

Problem 1:

Write a Java program that reads a student name, his/her age, and his/her height (in feet) from the console and prints out all pieces of data related to a student, i.e. name, age, and height, in one line of the output console.

Example of output: John Smith	30	5.9

Important Notes:
•	Assumed that the user always correctly enters the input.
•	In Eclipse IDE, inside the newly created project HOMEWORK_1, students should create a new program, i.e. a class, named: Program_1, under a new package named PROBLEM_1 for his/her work on this problem.
•	To submit, students copy all the code of the program into a Notepad file (and keep all the original Eclipse format) – NOT Microsoft Words, name the file as “hw1_Program1” (the file should have the suffix .txt), and submit it via E-Learning (attach the file)

Problem 2:

Write a Java program that can calculate and print out the area of a circle. The user enters data of the radius and its measurement unit (“in” for inch, “ft” for feet, “cm” for centimeter, and “m” for meter) from the console. The program should check to be sure that the radius is not negative and the measurement unit must be one among the listed-above units. 

Important Notes:
•	Assumed that the user makes mistakes at most once for the radius value andonce for the measurement unit while entering the data, i.e. he/she enters the correct value the next time right after being warned.
•	In Eclipse IDE, inside the newly created project HOMEWORK_1, students should create a new program, i.e. a class, named: Program_2 under a new package named PROBLEM_2 for his/her work on this problem.
•	To submit, students copy all the code of the program into a Notepad file (and keep all the original Eclipse format) – NOT Microsoft Words, name the file as “hw1_Program2” (the file should have the suffix .txt), and submit it via E-Learning (attach the file)



Problem 3:

Write a Java program that can compute the interest on the next monthly mortgage payment. The program reads the balance and the annual percentage interest rate (e.g.: for an interest rate of 4.25%, the user should enter “4.25”) from the console.  The program should check to be sure that the inputs of balance and the interest rate are not negative. After the computation, the program displays the interest amount as a floating-point number with 2 digits after the floating point.

Formula: the interest on the next monthly mortgage payment can be computed using the following formula:
Interest = balance x (annualInterestRate / 1200)

Important Notes:
•	Assumed that the user makes mistakes at most once forthe balance and once for the annual percentage interest rate while entering the data, i.e. he/she enters the correct value the next time right after being warned.
•	In Eclipse IDE, inside the newly created project HOMEWORK_1, students should create a new program, i.e. a class, named: Program_3 under a new package named PROBLEM_3 for his/her work on this problem.
•	To submit, students copy all the code of the program into a Notepad file (and keep all the original Eclipse format) – NOT Microsoft Words, name the file as “hw1_program3” (the file should have the suffix .txt), and submit it via E-Learning (attach the file)

Problem 4:

Write a program that can compare the unit (per lb) cost of sugar sold in packages with different weights and prices. The program prompts the user to enter the weight and price of package 1, then does the same for package 2, and displays the results to indicate sugar in which package has a better price. It is assumed that the weight of all packages is measured in lb. The program should check to be sure that both the inputs of weight and price are both positive values.

Important Notes:
•	Assumed that the user makes mistakes at most once for the weight and once for the price while entering the data, i.e. he/she enters the correct value the next time right after being warned.
•	In Eclipse IDE, inside the newly created project HOMEWORK_1, students should create a new program, i.e. a class, named: Program_4 under a new package named PROBLEM_4 for his/her work on this problem.
•	To submit, students copy all the code of the program into a Notepad file (and keep all the original Eclipse format) – NOT Microsoft Words, name the file as “hw1_program4” (the file should have the suffix .txt), and submit it via E-Learning (attach the file)



Problem 5:

Write a program that can convert an integer between 0 and 15 into hex number. The user enters an integer from the console and the program displays the corresponding hex number. If the user enters an integer out of range, the program displays a warning message about the invalid input.


Important Notes:
•	Assumed that the user makes mistakesat most once while entering the data, i.e. he/she enters the correct value the next time right after being warned.
•	In Eclipse IDE, inside the newly created project HOMEWORK_1, students should create a new program, i.e. a class, named: Program_5 under a new package named PROBLEM_5 for his/her work on this problem.
•	To submit, students copy all the code of the program into a Notepad file (and keep all the original Eclipse format) – NOT Microsoft Words, name the file as “hw1_program5” (the file should have the suffix .txt), and submit it via E-Learning (attach the file)
